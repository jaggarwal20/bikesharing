## 3.0 Summary
In conclusion a majority of the bikes are used during the weekday by male subscribers before and after work with most of the rides lasting 5 minutes.  In Des Moines, it is suggested to keep the bikes near public transpotation to allow users to commute to their end location.  It is also wise to target males who are more likely to bike than females.
